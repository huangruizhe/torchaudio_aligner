- ESPnet Backend
  - CTC models from ESPnet
  - Dependency concerns (large install)
- RNN-T + ngram LM Backend
- support one-to-many mapping for TN -- this will improve recall without hurting accuracy
- nbest decoding or beam decoding before LIS
- pattern-based automatic k2 version detection
- lis version 1.0
- HTML Visualization -- click and play on the words, more fancy visualization like real time playing etc
- use https://github.com/MahmoudAshraf97/ctc-forced-aligner as underlying alignment support
- implement eval utils for research/engineering experiments
- make it an annotation/inspection helper.
- when speech has non-matched segments, we should distinguish this
- code switching example
- overlapped speech?
- anchor timestamps (from Kevin Duh)
- get recording in the demo (add to audio frontend)
- multi-pass process
- silence? junk? how did you define them?
