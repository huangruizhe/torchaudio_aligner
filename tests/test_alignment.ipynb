    "# Test Notebook: Alignment Module\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tests the `alignment` module for speech-to-text alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features tested:**\n",
    "1. Module imports and structure\n",
    "2. Data classes (AlignmentResult, AlignedWord, AlignedToken)\n",
    "3. WFST factor transducer construction\n",
    "4. Tokenizers (Character, BPE, Phoneme) - via unified `text_frontend`\n",
    "5. Audio segmentation - via unified `audio_frontend`\n",
    "6. LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence) utilities\n",
    "7. MFA backend availability\n",
    "8. Gentle backend availability\n",
    "9. Full WFST Aligner integration\n",
    "10. **Segment-wise alignment API** (for use with stitching_utils)\n",
    "11. **Ground truth data** loading\n",
    "12. **Run WFST alignment** on sample audio\n",
    "13. **Accuracy comparison** (frame error, IoU metrics)\n",
    "14. **Listening test** (audio preview of aligned words)\n",
    "15. **MFA aligner test** (if installed)\n",
    "16. **Gentle aligner test** (if installed)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture:**\n",
    "The alignment module produces **SEGMENT-WISE** results (each segment aligned independently).\n",
    "For global alignment, use `stitching_utils` to combine segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alignment Backends:**\n",
    "| Backend | Description | Fuzzy Support | Languages |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|---------------|-----------|\n",
    "| `WFSTAligner` | k2-based factor transducer | ✅ Yes | 1100+ (MMS) |\n",
    "| `MFAAligner` | Montreal Forced Aligner | ❌ No | 50+ |\n",
    "| `GentleAligner` | Kaldi-based (English) | ❌ No | English only |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key methods:**\n",
    "- `aligner.align_segments(waveform, text)` → `List[SegmentAlignmentResult]` (no stitching)\n",
    "- `aligner.align(waveform, text, stitch=True)` → `AlignmentResult` (with optional stitching)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy Testing:**\n",
    "- Ground truth from MMS-FA CTC alignment (50fps frame rate)\n",
    "- Metrics: Frame error (start/end), IoU (boundary overlap)\n",
    "- Audio preview: `preview_word(idx)`, `preview_word_by_name(\"CURIOSITY\")`, `preview_all_words()`\n",
    "\n",
